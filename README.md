# Rugby Scoreboard
[https://catherinealicewood.github.io/Rugby-Scoreboard/]
## Created as part of the Scrimba Frontend Web Dev Career Path
I took up the basketball scoreboard solo project task from the course but decided to do a rugby scoreboard instead!
The buttons for each team add to their score for a try, conversion or penalty.
The scores then change colour depending on who's winning or whether it's a draw.

### Notes:
- used Bootstrap for the layout to create the two columns
- just did some simply styling in CSS - JS functionality is the main feature
- used vanilla JS to get that solid before making something with jQuery
- stored elements in variables to try and keep code DRY but bet it could be DRYer!
- I did very little Googling! - Trying to get familiar with the syntax and solve problems by trial and error to increase my learning
### If I was to develop this further I could :
- Add input fields for team names
- Improve the styling
- Add animations when teams score
- Add half time and final scores
